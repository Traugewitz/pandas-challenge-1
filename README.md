# pandas-challenge-1
Module 4
In this challenge, I analyzed a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring and analyzing the data to address real-world business questions. I identified top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more. I found this module 4 challenge to be particularly challenging as I transformed, and analyzed complex data scenarios.

Different functions within Pandas, as well as many self-defined functions were used to complete this module challenge.

I did utilize chatGPT to help understand questions and different ways to attack solutions.  I also relied on help from classmates on defining functions to calculate and summarize the data.
